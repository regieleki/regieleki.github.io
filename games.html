									<h2>NES Zelda Remake & Custom Level</h2>

									<p>Controls: WASD or arrow keys. Z/X to use weapon. Space to switch between alt weapons. "4" for the custom level.
									<br>
									This was our first project in EECS 494. Made with C# in Unity. Along with my partner, we recreated the first dungeon of Zelda NES,
									and then created a custom level with a new laser mechanic. I implemented much of the environment, camera functionality, movement, health, inventory
									and damage management, collectable items, interactable doors and obstacles. I also worked on the Bladetrap enemy and bomb weapon. For our custom
									level, I worked on level design and implemented the lasers themselves, and all their associated logic.

									<h2>Countdown: Rapid-prototype game</h2>
									<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/3037370" width="552" height="167"><a href="https://regigigas.itch.io/countdown">Countdown by regigigas</a></iframe>
									<p>Controls: WASD or arrow keys. R to reset the level.
									<br>
									This was my second project for EECS 494, which was a test of rapidly prototyping a game centered around a novel mechanic. Countdown is a puzzle game
									where the stage responds to the player's movement, while the player tries to find the best path to the end of the stage-- before the stage itself 
									prevents it.

									<h2>Open Catsket: 6-week capstone project</h2>
									<iframe src="https://itch.io/embed/3165834" width="552" height="167" frameborder="0"><a href="https://eshaready.itch.io/open-catsket">Open Catsket by Catpurrture Studios</a></iframe>
									<p>Controls: WASD or arrow keys. ESC for menu, SHIFT to shift, Z to lift box, SPACE/UP to jump.
									<br>
									Open Catsket, a Shrodinger's Cat themed puzzle platformer, was our final project in EECS 494. Our team of 5 had 6 weeks to build a game up from the ground, with the 
									desired final project being smooth to play, bug-free, novel, and a good 20 or so minutes from start to finish! You play as the titular cat from the Shrodinger experiment,
									and after your labratory is mysteriously evacuated, you realize now is your chance to escape. Utilizing your ability to shift from an alive cat to a dead cat through 
									scattered boxes, you can solve puzzles, meet your fellow lab cats, and perhaps even manage to see the outside world.
									<br>
									For this project, I worked heavily on programming, headed the narrative, and worked alongside another team member in creating all the art for game (overworld sprites, cutscenes, logo,
									and dialogue sprites).
