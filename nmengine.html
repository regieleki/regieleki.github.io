							<p>A lot of the second week's feature progress was dedicated to shifting the server out of the game engine itself, and into a standalone nodejs server. This, in turn, required a change of serialization. Data is now sent through JSON format rather than direct
              byte (de)serialization. The largest issue of not being able to see synced-up clients was also fixed, demonstrating very basic network connectivity.</p>

							<p>For my engine's custom feature, I wanted to see if I could attempt basic networking capabilities over the span of two weeks. Much of the first week was dedicated to learning the ins and outs of SDL_Net (used due to the already existing use of SDL_Image/Audio/Text, 
							and building up from there. My engine served both as the server and client, with the command line args dictating the way it would run. I was not able to successfuly get client screen sync to work, but through debug logs, was assured that I was successfully serializing and deserializing
							data between the server and the client(s).</p>
